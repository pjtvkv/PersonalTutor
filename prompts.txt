User story: create a batch job to process text files and generate embeddings

As a developer
I want to create a batch job that processes text files, chunks their content, and generates embeddings using OpenAI API
So that we can create vector representations of our text content for semantic search and analysis
Make all the changes inside a folder named embeddings inside the batch folder.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Read text files from the text_output directory
- [ ] Split text content into chunks of appropriate size
- [ ] Generate embeddings for each chunk using OpenAI's embedding API
- [ ] Print embeddings to console with file name and chunk ID
- [ ] Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully
- [ ] Log processing status and any errors

User story: now make changes in embeddings_generator.py write the file name, chunk id, chunk content and embedding to a json file

user story: make total change in app.py to create a web app that uses the embeddings generated by the batch job to search for relevant text chunks based on user query
