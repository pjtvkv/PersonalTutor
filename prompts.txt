The python job should run in a container.
The input pdf folder and the output text folder should be mounted.
The application code should also be mounted.

User story: create a batch job to process text files and generate embeddings

As a developer
I want to create a batch job that processes text files, chunks their content, and generates embeddings using OpenAI API
So that we can create vector representations of our text content for semantic search and analysis
Make all the changes inside a folder named embeddings inside the batch folder.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Read text files from the text_output directory
- [ ] Split text content into chunks of appropriate size
- [ ] Generate embeddings for each chunk using OpenAI's embedding API
- [ ] Print embeddings to console with file name and chunk ID
- [ ] Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully
- [ ] Log processing status and any errors
